Agent Mouse Simulation
This project simulates an AI-controlled mouse agent that interacts with the screen using pyautogui. The agent uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to make decisions based on screen captures, and it learns through Q-learning. The simulation includes features like energy management, dynamic food spawning, reward systems, and real-time visualization.

Key Features:
Screen Capture: The agent captures a 100x100 region around the mouse cursor to make decisions.

Neural Network: A CNN processes the screenshot and predicts actions (move, click, etc.).

Q-Learning: The agent uses Q-values to decide actions and updates its neural network based on rewards.

Reward System: The agent is rewarded for clicking, right-clicking, and causing screen changes.

Energy Management: The agent loses energy over time and must click on food targets to replenish it.

Dynamic Environment: Food targets spawn randomly on the screen.

Real-Time Visualization: The simulation is visualized using matplotlib.

Use Cases:
AI-controlled automation.

Reinforcement learning experiments.

Interactive simulations.

Python Setup Guide
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher.

pip (Python package manager).

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
bash
Copy
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
myenv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source myenv/bin/activate
3. Install Required Packages
Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install tensorflow pyautogui numpy matplotlib pillow
4. Run the Simulation
Run the simulation script:

bash
Copy
python agent_mouse_full.py
5. Customize the Simulation
You can customize the simulation by modifying the settings dictionary in the script:

python
Copy
settings = {
    "agent": {"max_speed": 5, "energy": 100, "energy_decay": 0.1},
    "food": {"count": 5, "size": 20, "color": "green"},
    "spawn_rate": 2,  # How often new food spawns (in seconds)
    "reward": {"click": 10, "right_click": 20, "scroll": 5, "change": 50},
}
6. Troubleshooting
TensorFlow Installation Issues:

Ensure you have Python 3.8â€“3.11 (TensorFlow does not support Python 3.12+ yet).

If TensorFlow fails to install, try the CPU-only version:

bash
Copy
pip install tensorflow-cpu
PyAutoGUI Permissions:

On macOS, grant accessibility permissions to Python in System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility.

Matplotlib Backend Issues:

If the visualization window does not appear, install a different backend for matplotlib:

bash
Copy
pip install pyqt5
Then set the backend in your script:

python
Copy
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Qt5Agg')
